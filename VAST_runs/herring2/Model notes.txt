~/VAST_runs/herring2
herring_model_2.R

Run successfully 2 Apr 2023

Observation data contained in data object `surv`
	- Years: 1993 - 2021
	- Response variable: KG herring+mackerel+menhaden caught
	- Effort: 1, attempts to code in as unitless fail, reads in as km2
	- Lat & Lon - decimal degrees

No density covariates

No catchability covariate data

Spatial grid area contained in data object `grid_NWA_BTS`
	- US EEZ waters from Cape Hatteras through Canadian maritime border
	- Points on land excluded
	- Currently using 200 knots and max 2000 grid cells (2000 is default and would need to be changed)
	- Grid has 25km by 25km cells, whereas tuna grid has 10km by 10km cells

Settings
	- ObsModel error structure set to [2,4]
		- ObsModel[ ,4] set because encounter rate is 100% for all years
	- FieldConfig & RhoConfig default values
		- All IID for FieldConfig
		- All 0 for RhoConfig
	- Anisotropy on
	- Space-building method: mesh
	- Knot-buiding method: grid
	- Fine-scale OFF
	- Bias correct OFF

Future
	- Model should be able to take unitless area, but doesn't for some reason

Changes from previous model
	- Combines other species for better spatial coverage and more realistic prey field
	- Updated grid to more coarse grid cells
