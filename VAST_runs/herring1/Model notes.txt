Run successfully 30 Mar 2023

Observation data contained in data object `surv`
	- Years: 1993 - 2021
	- Response variable: KG herring caught
	- Effort: unitless 1
	- Lat & Lon - decimal degrees

No density covariates

No catchability covariate data

Spatial grid area contained in data object `grid_NWA_BTS`
	- US EEZ waters from Cape Hatteras through Canadian maritime border
	- Points on land excluded
	- Currently using 200 knots and max 2000 grid cells (2000 is default and would need to be changed)

Settings
	- ObsModel error structure set to [2,4]
		- ObsModel[ ,4] set because encounter rate is 100% for all years
	- FieldConfig & RhoConfig default values
		- All IID for FieldConfig
		- All 0 for RhoConfig
	- Anisotropy on
	- Space-building method: mesh
	- Knot-buiding method: grid
	- Fine-scale OFF
	- Bias correct OFF

Future
	- Issue with units: cannot make spatial density plots. Fix.
