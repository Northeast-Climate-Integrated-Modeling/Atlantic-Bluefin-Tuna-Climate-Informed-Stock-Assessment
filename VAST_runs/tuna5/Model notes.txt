Run successfully 11 Apr 2023

Observation data contained in data object `surv`
	- Years: 1993 - 2021
	- Categories: Small (young school, school, large school) and Large (large medium, giant)
	- Response variable: CPUE (num caught each size group per trip/ fishing hours per trip)
	- Effort: unitless 1
	- Lat & Lon - decimal degrees, calculated from DDMM data provided during interviews

Density covariate data contained in data object `scaled.covars`
	- Density covariate data have been scaled as per recommendation from J Thorson
	- SST: Recaulculated as deg C (provided as F, removed NA values and unrealistic values)
		- Unrealistic or missing values replaced with data from OISST data
	- Depth: Recalculated as M (provided as ft, removed NA values and unrealistic values)
		- Unrealistic or missing values replaced with data from GEBCO 15 arc-second bathy raster data
	- Prey: prey field (25 km grid cells) as created by separate VAST model for combined menhaden, mackerel, and herring data
	- AMO: Monthly Atlantic multidecadal oscillation index value (spatially non-variable)
	- NAO: daily north Atlantic oscillation index value (spatially non-variable)

No catchability covariate data

Spatial grid area contained in data object `grid_NWA_BTS`
	- US EEZ waters from Cape Hatteras through Canadian maritime border
	- Points on land excluded
	- Currently using 200 knots and max 2000 grid cells (2000 is default and would need to be changed)

Settings
	- ObsModel error structure set to [4,1]
		- ObsModel[4, ]: Delta-lognormal using bias-corrected-mean and log-coeff of var
		- ObsModel[ ,1]: Poisson-link delta-model using log-link for numbers density (pred 1) and log-link for biomass per number (pred2)
	- FieldConfig
		- Epsilon2 value approaches 0 when building model, turned off (0)
		- All other FieldConfig values default (IID)
	- RhoConfig 
		- All values default (0)
	- Anisotropy on
	- Space-building method: mesh
	- Knot-buiding method: grid
	- Fine-scale OFF
	- Bias correct OFF

Major Changes from previous model:
	- Included AMO and NAO as density covariates

Future
	- Refine spatial grid: is it realistic to go all the way out to 200nmi or should I bring it inshore a bit
		- We don't have any samples in the offshore half or so of the shapefile
		- Examination of data proves we have no observations in water deeper than 3000 m
	- Observation data: Pre 2002 data has very few trips with 0 recorded catch-- this clearly impacts the calculated index values
		- Consider removing that data? Or somehow change error structure? Don't think I can set non-encounter spaces to 0 reliably.
	- Add wind direction and pressure data
	- Start to run covariate selection tests
